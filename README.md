# Calculator

## DUE: 6 Mar 2019

## Instructions:

Create an Calculator Android application using the **GridLayout**. Your calculator should be fully funtional and perform actions correctly. For example, 2 + 2 should equal 4. All arithmetic should be correct, as you would expect from any app you install. The 'C' button should clear the last number entered, but not clear out the current operation. The 'CE' button should clear out the entire current operation. There are two requirements when the phone rotates: **1.** All state of the app should be preserved. If I press '2' and a '+' and rotate the phone, I should be able to press '2' and '=' and get 4 back. **2.** The layout should change. Notice from the example screenshot that number of rows and columns change whether you are in Portrait or Landscape mode. The example screenshot shows what will get you a B+/A-. 

Examples of (but not limited to) WOW factors:
* Scientific calculator functions
* Slide out drawer for scientific functions (in portrait mode)
* Keep a list of past operations

### TODO:
1. Open Android Studio and create an Android project named Calculator-\<yourLastName\>.
2. Create a .gitignore file and put the neccessary file names that do not belong in GitHub.
3. Create a README.md and put '\#README' in it.
4. VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
5. Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
6. Complete the project.
 
 When you are complete with your project, commit and push files to GitHub. VCS -> Commit Changes
